      <p>
      The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) was founded in 1867. Since its founding, it has grown to become the fifth-largest state agency 
      within Illinois when it comes to square footage.
      </p>
      <p>
      The graph below shows the growth of UIUC over time since 1867. It shows that while there was explosive growth in the past,
      the growth rate has slowed as property has become harder to obtain in Urbana and Champaign.
